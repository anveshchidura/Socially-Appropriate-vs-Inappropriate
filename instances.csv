This is an open Mastodon instance, basically.
It's run by the person you see on the right (that's me!) and for now, that's all.
There might be more admins and moderators later if the needs come but alas not yet.

I hope this instance works okay for you, and that you can find a nice and welcoming community here! Feel free to hit me up if you have any questions or requests, be it about this instance, how to make your own instance, or other things not related to Mastodon.

I am actually the only sysadmin of this instance and I can't work full-time on oldbytes.space so, I will do whatever I can in a reasonable time to make it works the best it can.

Rules
This instance has some rules, of course.
First, there are the usual : no sexism, no racism, no hate speech, no LGBTQphobia, no nazis, no spam, no public unflagged porn, etc...
Then, I also believe it's important to remind you that this server was made and is run by a queer activist.
This server thrives to be inclusive, and I will ban without much regret.
People are encouraged to use the report function as they see fit, and can be confident that their complaints will be heard and dealt with in some way. I want everyone to feel safe here, and if that doesn't sound like something you like, you should probably find another server.

There's also a pretty important activism aspect of this instance.
If you're a marketer, a #digital #influencer, this is not the place for you. Not only do I feel you should not feel welcome, I intend to make you feel definitely NOT welcome.
This instance, and this entire social network in my opinion, is dedicated to reclaiming social media, decentralizing, and generally creating better and more engaging communities.
The three categories of people I mentioned earlier are not, in my opinion, working towards this goal, pretty much the opposite, and they are not welcome on this server.

Welcome to Inanna! Inanna wants to help women get better sexual experiences - orgasming each time is a high bar, but making it enjoyable each time is entirely possible.

How to use this site? If you are a woman: write down and share your most mind-blowing experiences; be inspired by other women and discover new territories; mark the toots you like via ""Boost"" and share your username with your partner ;)

If you are a man: read and learn (you are welcome); join the discussion by asking a question, sharing your experiences; be humble and open-minded.

Why create Inanna? Female sexual pleasure deserves far more attention than it currently does - not only by men, but also by women themselves. Inanna is not for dating or hookups. However, you are encouraged to use Inanna to find out what your partner likes üêò We are fully aware of the sensitivity here, hence we chose Mastodon to ensure anonymity and no secret data abuse.

We are very serious about keeping banana dog clean and troll-free, so please consider your account an investment and treat it accordingly. Read the rules, use common sense, and help keep banana dog the best instance on mastodon!

General Conduct

Before you post:
Before posting, please ask yourself the following question: ""Am I making a post which is either funny, informative, or interesting on any level?""

If you can answer ""yes"" to this, then please post. If you cannot, then refrain from posting. If you post anyway, the mods may censor your post.

Before you reply:
Before replying, please ask yourself the following question: ""Does my reply offer any significant advice or help contribute to the conversation in any fashion?""

If you can answer ""yes"" to this, then please reply. If you cannot, then refrain from replying.
Posting Rules

Low Content Posts:
Please do not make posts containing no content (ie, ""first post,"" ""hello, I'm new here,"" etc.). These just litter up the timeline. If you do not like a post, then just ignore it and move on; replies consisting solely of trolling fall into this category. As a general rule, write as if you were speaking in real life to another human being.

Worthless Posts:
We do not care if you are drunk or high; please do not inform us of either. Please do not post crap asking us to vote for you on some website, give you referrals for free iPods / flatscreens / spare tires, or any other semi-spam things.

Leet Haxoring:
Don't fuck with this instance or any of its users. If you post a malicious link (any URL with spyware or code designed to annoy people) you will be banned. Do not make plans to annoy / destroy other users / instances.

Stay On Target:
Try to use the appropriate hash tag for your posts. This helps people find your post and makes the instance more user friendly.
Also, Mastodon supports content warnings so please consider using them. Examples may include posting spoilers for a brand new movie, discussing something gross or maybe just containing a political rant.

Respect the Mods:
The moderators are here to keep the instance safe, sane, and secure. If they ask you to do something, please do it. Please do not harass or intentionally annoy the mods. If you do not like the mods or the moderation, feel free to contact me @debugninja@banana.dog.

Harass and Sass:
If somebody is harassing you report it to a mod or the admin. Disagreement does not constitute harassment. Please do not post others' personal information (phone number, addresses, emails, etc.). Try to stay out of other peoples' personal lives as well. Keep in mind there's a good distinction between the Internet and real life.

Account Ability:
You are solely responsible for the content posted from your account. Please secure it accordingly.

Crazy Catchall:
Please do not try to cleverly circumvent some rule listed here. These rules are general guidelines and are very flexible.

I Hate Speech:
Offensive terms such as ""faggot"" or ""nigger"" may or may not be bannable based on context of the toot. This rule is completely, 100% subjective and is based on the mod reading the post at the time.

This is freespeech.host, a place for thinkers of all varieties to discuss... well, pretty much anything they like. Perhaps especially ""controversial"" topics that might be risky to talk about in other places. Put bluntly, I'm a free speech absolutist -- but not everyone else who I might federate with is, and thus cooperation places limitations. My intention is to give you as much freedom to discuss whatever you like as is possible.

Politics is a hot topic in most places, but you can toot about anything you please, with few limitations. Please bear in mind this is intended mostly to be about discussions so there may be better places for those interested in posting artwork, etc, unless for some reason you feel your artwork might be unwelcome. If its unlawful I'll still remove it, though.

Code of Conduct
The Idealish community expects that all network activities, events, and digital forums:
Are a safe and respectful environment for all participants.
Are a place where people are free to fully express their identities.
Presume the value of others. Everyone‚Äôs ideas, skills, and contributions have value.
Don‚Äôt assume everyone has the same context, and encourage questions.
Find a way for people to be productive with their skills (technical and not) and energy.
Use language such as ‚Äúyes/and‚Äù, not ‚Äúno/but.‚Äù
Encourage members and participants to listen as much as they speak.
Strive to build tools that are open and free technology for public use. Activities that aim to foster public use, not private gain, are prioritized.
Prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process.
Work to ensure that the community is well-represented in the planning, design, and implementation of civic tech. This includes encouraging participation from women, minorities, and traditionally marginalized groups.
Actively involve community groups and those with subject matter expertise in the decision-making process.
Ensure that the relationships and conversations between community members, the local government staff and community partners remain respectful, participatory, and productive.
Provide an environment where people are free from discrimination or harassment.

<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
<p>We do have a Code of Conduct that you agree to abide by when you sign up for an account with our instance! Please read it carefully to make sure you agree with everything listed; we want to be a welcoming instance, but if our instance is not a good fit for your views or intentions we want you to find a place that fits better for your content. :)</p>

<h2>Be nice!</h2>
<p>This is a <em>community</em> of people (that is, by federating with other instances, connected to other communities of people). So when interacting with others, we expect that you will make every effort to be compassionate to other users. If you find this to be a difficult thing with a particular user, we encourage use of block and/or mute options, or you can always discuss things with <a href=""https://witchey.club/@witch_min"">@witch_min</a>. (If a user is breaking this Code of Conduct, however, please <em>report them</em> and the matter will be taken care of asap.)</p>
<p>This also includes not posting content that is racist, anti-semitic, misogynist, homophobic, biphobic, transphobic or transmisogynist, ableist, or furthering or promoting hatred or harm towards any oppressed group.</p>

<h2>No harassment. Period.</h2>
<p>This includes:
<ul>
<li>dogpiling</li>
<li>attempting to evade someone blocking you</li>
<li>directing others to attack someone</li>
<li>spreading false information about someone</li>
</ul>
<p>If someone is breaking our Code of Conduct, again, please <em>report them</em>, don't dogpile them.</p>

<h2>Please use the CW feature for:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Any kind of sexual content and/or nudity (including via text)</li>
<li>Political discussion</li>
<li>Mental health discussion (including suicide)</li>
<li>Flashing gifs or flashing videos</li>
<li>Drug and alcohol use</li>
<li>Medical or weight related topics (including diet and food)</li>
<li>Violence or death (of people or of animals), including discussion of abuse or sexual violence</li>
<li>Ranting or ""subtoots"" about any user</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why?</h4>
<p>These are topics that are commonly upsetting or triggering to many people. As a welcoming and friendly space for social conversation, we want to make sure everyone is as comfortable here as they want to be. Using the CW (content warning) feature for these things or any topic you personally feel may be upsetting gives other users the option of determining whether or not they're in a state of mind capable of reading these topics. It's a way of letting people decide what to engage with.</p>

<h2>Please use the ""unlisted"" feature for:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Any posts from bot accounts (including but not limited to image bots and ""ebooks"" style bots)</li>
<li>Making large amounts of toots in short periods of time</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why?</h4>
<p>Our Mastodon instance federates with other instances. This means that our public toots appear on the ""federated timeline"" of any instance we're federating with. If an instance has a large amount of annoying or spam content flooding the federated timeline, the entire instance may be silenced by the admins of other instances. We want to avoid that! Please help us in this endeavor.</p>

<h2>We don't want ANY of the following content AT ALL:</h2>
<ul>
<li>any kind of sexual content involving anyone under the age of 18, including written or drawn content</li>
<li>any kind of sexual content directed at a user who has not consented to it</li>
<li>Holocaust denial, Nazi symbolism, or any anti-semitic or pro-white supremacist content</li>
<li>pro-fascist or pro- violent nationalist content</li>
<li>Islamophobic content</li>
<li>mockery of people asking for donations</li>
<li>antagonism towards sex workers</li>
<li>content defending any of the above</li>
</ul>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Don't be an asshole, and use the CW and privacy features appropriately.</p>
